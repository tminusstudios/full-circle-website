    text: "Becca is wonderful. The space is welcoming. As always, Becca has great attention to detail. She massages based on what's needed. She listens and applies just the right amount of pressure to those areas that require a little extra attention. Also, Becca is a yoga teacher. Her yoga training provides great insight into how the body works. She integrates that knowledge into her massages. I wish I could go every week. I highly recommend her.",

    text: "I've been working with Cody for over a year. From the onset he has taken a very holistic approach to my fitness - not just developing an \"exercise\" plan tailored to my goals but going far beyond that to help me rectify existing bad habits and prior injuries. I am constantly impressed by his commitment to continuously refining my program and ensuring I continue to progress. In fact, Cody maintains a far better focus on goal setting and improvement than I ever would on my own. Combine these strengths with his hunger to constantly improve his own knowledge and I can say without doubt that I have never met a more effective trainer. Finally, Cody is a great pleasure to work with. I recommend Cody without any reservation.",

After just a little over a month, I can't believe the difference!! Not to mention how much stronger I feel as well! Thank you, Cody!! Highly recommend, especially for athletes with chronic conditions!",

    text: "I have attended and benefited from in-person Forrest yoga classes taught by Becca for approximately four years. During the pandemic, Becca has successfully modified her teaching to zoom offerings. Becca has proven herself to be adept at delivering everything that I value in a yoga class: she is personable, she is extremely knowledgeable, she is articulate and she knows when to demonstrate and when it is not necessary. She accommodates every participant's skill level and offers alternate poses for those with limitations or injuries. Becca prompts clearly and is skilled in spotting adjustments that benefit each student. Her classes are a \"whole body\" workout without being too taxing or introducing risk of injury. I cannot recommend Becca enough!",

  {
    question: "What does a personal trainer do?",
    answer: "A personal trainer's goal is to help you get stronger, move better, and live better. While there are numerous benefits, the biggest one is that you are exercising under the supervision of a trained and educated professional. This mitigates the risk of injury and increases the likelihood of success. People often get hurt when they start new exercise programs on their own. Having guidance is KEY.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between a personal trainer and a physical therapist?",
    answer: "There is a lot of overlap in the goals of personal trainering and physical therapy. Physical therapists are able to diagnose injury professionally. You should go to a physical therapist if you have been told to do so by a medical professional. If you are medically cleared to exercise and would like to develop a fitness routine that is able to suite your lifestyle, you should consider a personal trainer.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does personal training cost?",
    answer: "Our services start at just $52 per session for semi-private and $69 per session for individuals.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is personal training so expensive?",
    answer: "Personal training is an investment in your future. You are investing in yourself with the expectation that you are going to reach your goals while feeling good and staying safe. At Full Circle Function & Fitness we keep training and education up to date and make sure to provide incredible value that justifies the cost!",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get a personal trainer if I work out at home?",
    answer: "Absolutely! If you prefer to work out at home we can work with you virtually. You get customized monthly programming designed to help you reach your goals. Including customized monthly programming, video and text exercise instruction, and video form checks.",
  },
  {
    question: "I don't want to get hurt or have pain – don't people get hurt lifting weights?",
    answer: "Yes, people do get hurt lifting weights. However, strength training is a requirement in life and prevents us from getting hurt, if done properly; therefore, it is of utmost importance to hire a professional. One of the biggest goals of our staff is to keep you pain-free (and help you get out of pain if you already have it!)",
  },
  {
    question: "What should my exercise frequency be to notice a difference?",
    answer: "The CDC recommends at least 4 days per week of exercise. With time and financial constraints, this is not an option for everyone. Clients that come 2 days per week and then stay active outside of the studio have seen major quality of life improvements!",
  },
  {
    question: "What is included in my personal training session?",
    answer: "60 minute personalized training. Personalized programming to ensure you reach your goals. Home exercises to deal with nagging pain or injuries that might be present. Bonus for recurring clients: Great conversation with people down to talk about almost anything!",
  },
  {
    question: "How long do people usually work with a personal trainer?",
    answer: "Everyone is different: someone might be getting ready for a wedding or a sporting event, so they want to work with a professional for a few months. Some people just want to live a long, healthy, and strong life. Sometimes life circumstances change, and they can no longer continue training or maybe they want to train more! There is no one size that fits all answer.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the benefits of personal training?",
    answer: "While there are numerous benefits, the biggest one is that you are exercising under the supervision of a trained and educated professional. This mitigates the risk of injury and increases the likely hood of success. People often get hurt when they start new exercise programs on their own so having guidance is KEY.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you help with nutrition as well?",
    answer: "While we do not currently have a registered dietitian on staff, we are able to make nutritional recommendations and teach what a lifestyle of healthy eating habits looks like.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there an age limit for personal training?",
    answer: "None! However, minors must be accompanied by an adult.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a target audience that hires a personal trainer?",
    answer: "Anyone looking to feel and look better, get stronger and improve overall function.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to have an exercise base before starting to work with you?",
    answer: "Not at all! All skill levels are welcome (beginners are in the lucky position of not having developed bad habits!)",
  },
  {
    question: "What type of workouts are my sessions focused on?",
    answer: "This is all based on your personal goals. Our trained staff will take your goals into account while also pursuing the goal of making your body stronger, more resilient, and more mobile!",
