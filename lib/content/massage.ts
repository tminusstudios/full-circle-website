      content:
        "Our massage therapists don't just address symptoms — they look at the whole body. By combining traditional massage techniques with an understanding of movement and anatomy, we address the root causes of pain, tightness, and restriction. Every session starts with a conversation about what you're experiencing and what you want to achieve, so we can tailor the work to your specific needs. We use a combination of methods including myofascial release, deep tissue, Swedish massage, and movement-informed bodywork.",

      heading: "BENEFITS",
      content:
        "Regular massage therapy supports faster recovery from training, reduces chronic pain and tension, improves mobility, and helps manage the physical effects of stress. For athletes, it means less time sidelined and more time performing. For anyone dealing with chronic pain or stiffness, it can be transformative. Pairing massage therapy with personal training creates a comprehensive approach to how you feel, move, and perform every day.",
