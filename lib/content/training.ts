        "We believe strength training is the foundation of a healthy, functional life. Every program begins with a thorough fitness and movement assessment so we can identify your specific needs, movement patterns, and goals. From there, we build a fully personalized program designed around you — not a generic template. Whether your goal is to get stronger, move without pain, lose weight, or perform at a higher level, we create the roadmap to get you there.",

        "Every session is 60–75 minutes of one-on-one coaching. We track your progress, adjust your program as you improve, and hold you accountable every step of the way. Sessions include personalized programming, a warm-up tailored to your needs, strength and movement work, and a cool-down with mobility and recovery work. We also provide home exercises to address any nagging pain or imbalances. Expect to be challenged — and to see results.",
