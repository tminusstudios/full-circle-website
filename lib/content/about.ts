I followed my passion and graduated from California University of Pennsylvania with my Master of Science in Exercise Science and Health Promotion with dual concentration in Performance Enhancement and Injury Prevention / Rehabilitation Science in May of 2020. While completing my masters, I attended the Pittsburgh School of Massage Therapy and finished training in April of 2020.",

      "My journey into the world of wellness started in 2012 when I first stepped onto a yoga mat. At the time I was two years into the world of education, having received my B.S. in Mathematics with a Secondary Certification at Carlow University in 2010. Little did I know that trying out yoga one evening after school was going to change the trajectory of my life as much as it did! I did my first yoga teacher training in 2013 with Tias Little and started teaching on the side right away. I left Mathematics Education in 2014 and entered the world of yoga full time in 2015. I completed a second yoga training with Ana Forrest in 2016. My interest in working hands-on in yoga led me to the world of Massage Therapy, and I completed the Pittsburgh School of Massage Therapy program in 2020.",
      "I am absolutely fascinated by the body and mind and their inherent connection. I love to learn about anatomy and the human form in general. No part (bones, organs, brain, emotions, etc) is independent of the rest. No matter how obvious that may seem, it never ceases to amaze me. I truly believe working on the whole person - the body, the emotions, the mind - is the key to feeling more comfortable in one's own body.",
      "Each life is unique, which means each body is different. When it comes to private yoga, we'll talk first to make sure the style of yoga I teach is right for you. For massage, we will figure out together what method or combination of methods you will respond best to based on a discussion at the start of each session. Healing or managing pain and stress is a process. I look forward to helping you work through yours.",

      "I believe strength training to be the most rewarding form of training that can benefit any person regardless of age, gender, or fitness level. I was a multisport athlete growing up, so exercise has always been a part of my life but my passion for fitness truly began in college when I began educating myself in the exercise sciences. After completing my bachelor's from Clarion University in sport management and athletic coaching in 2012, I decided to go all in on pursuing a career in fitness. I went on to complete a dual concentration masters in exercise science and sport management from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 2014 and followed that up with acquiring my CSCS (certified strength and conditioning specialist) certification from the NSCA (National Strength and Conditioning Association).",
      "Since then, I have worked with and programmed for a variety of clientele with different backgrounds and starting points including high school and college athletes, general fitness enthusiasts, elderly, and powerlifters. I believe in leading by example, so I practice what I preach and hold myself to a high standard with my own goals/fitness. Powerlifting is my passion within the fitness world, and I have been competing in sanctioned meets since 2018. I have coached two masters level lifters (50-59) to multiple state and national records and even one world record deadlift. Everyone has the ability to improve their physical fitness and I would love the opportunity to talk to you about how to improve yours.",

      "My passion for fitness began as an athlete, growing up I enjoyed playing as many sports as I could. This led me to Grove City College to pursue a degree in exercise science as well as play water polo. As an athlete at Grove City I got my first taste of strength training, and I loved it. I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in which I could continue learning more about human movement and how the body works.",
      "Since graduating from Grove City College in 2022, I have gotten the chance to work with youth athletes in a strength and conditioning setting as well as college athletes as a water polo coach. In addition to working at Full Circle I am currently the assistant coach for Grove City's water polo team. As a recent college graduate I am excited to apply what I have learned in classes to a training setting, as well as continue to learn and grow in my knowledge so that I can best help you meet your fitness goals.",
      "Personally, I have shifted my own training focus from water polo performance to long term health, and in this transition I have enjoyed continuing to strength train while also exploring new sports like running. I love to spend time outside hiking, camping, and trail running, and I see my training as a way to keep me ready for any adventure. Regardless of what your own personal goals are, I know that strength training is essential to improving your fitness and keeping you pain free. I would love to talk to you about how I can help you improve your fitness and achieve your goals.",
